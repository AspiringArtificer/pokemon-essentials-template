        "# Introduction\n",
        "## Background\n",
        "Have you ever tried to use RPG Maker autotiles/terrain tiles in TileD or another mapping tool?\n",
        "\n",
        "It doesn't work great.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason is because RPG Maker's autotiles are actually subdivided into 4 'mini-tiles' which are composited back together into full-sized tiles as you paint.\n",
        "\n",
        "TileD can approximate this, but doesn't fully understand where each part of each tile goes. As such, it picks randomly for each of the edge and center peices, and doesn't create perfect patterns. If you already noticed this, well, that's probably why you're here.\n",
        "\n",
        "## This Program\n",
        "That's where this program comes in.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's purpose is to take RPG Maker tilesets (which are 9 tiles), take them apart, composite them, and output the 47-tile tilests that work better in basically every other program.\n",
        "\n",
        "You don't have to write any code to use it, but you do have to upload files, write in the names of those files, and change some other parameters. Then you have to go down a long list of 'code blocks' and run them with the little play buttons on the left of each block, one after the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "If it all goes well, it'll output your finished 47-tile tilesets at the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "## New Features\n",
        "- Can now stitch together all the autotiles into combined tilesets again! No more juggling 20+ pngs!\n",
        "- You can exclude tiles and have them extracted and set aside. Perfect for when rando tiles are jammed in with your autotiles.\n",
        "- Can actually stitch together any documents that contain tiles that are all organized the same. This saves space and lets you combine autotiles form multiple source files.\n",
        "- Code has documentation built in; if you take it and use it in your own editor, like VSCode, it's easier to find your way around\n",
        "\n",
        "## Notes\n",
        "This is a strict upgrade to the converter found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pK-jr_15GjqxKqSUtrmQuLVsSE2_IQq_?usp=sharing) I'm leaving a link to it because it's less intimidating to anyone who's never worked with Python before, and might encourage them to try making their own tools."
