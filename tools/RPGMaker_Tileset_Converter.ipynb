        "\n",
        "It doesn't work great.\n",

        "The reason is because RPG Maker's autotiles are actually subdivided into 4 'mini-tiles' which are composited back together into full-sized tiles as you paint.\n",
        "\n",
        "TileD can *approximate* this, but doesn't fully understand where each part of each tile goes. As such, it picks randomly for each of the edge and center peices, and doesn't create perfect patterns. If you already noticed this, well, that's probably why you're here.\n",

        "## This Program\n",
        "That's where this program comes in.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's purpose is to take RPG Maker tilesets (which are 9 tiles), take them apart, composite them, and output the 47-tile tilests that work better in basically every other program.\n",
        "\n",
        "You don't have to *write* any code to use it, but you do have to upload files, write in the names of those files, and change some other parameters. Then you have to go down a long list of 'code blocks' and run them with the little play buttons on the left of each block, one after the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "If it all goes well, it'll output your finished 47-tile tilesets at the end."
