# Pokemon Essentials Template (PET) Project

## Overview
This repo was created as a place to build out a template for developing games with pokemon-essentials. Since essentials is based on the outdate RMXP project struture, it's very difficult to develop with it using modern sensibilities around version control, modularity, and encapsulation of project elements. This template aims to remedy these issues.

The project has following goals:
* Enable development with full version control of all assets
* Maintain all binary elements as de-compiled source files
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility where possible
* Use only open-source tools, ideally build from source in-situ
* Minimize or eliminate the use of RMXP
